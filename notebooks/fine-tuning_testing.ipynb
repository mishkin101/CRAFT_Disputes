         "1699388451 Buyer: Hi there! I believe I received the wrong jersey from you! I was wondering if I could get a refund on my purchase? \n1699388553 Seller: Good afternoon! I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon. What can I do for you?\n1699389451 Buyer:  I was just going to say have a great rest of your day! \n1699389479 Seller: Thank you, you too!\n1699389486 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1699389501 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

The ad that I have does not say that it is a Kobe jersey. A store policy is that all sales are final. \n1699392234 Buyer: I understand that the ad doesn't say that now, but it did when I purchased the jersey. I would be more than happy to exchange it for the correct jersey and amend my review if that's done.\n1699392347 Seller: Well we are not selling the Kobe jersies for that price. The most I would be willing to do is that I will give you a refund for the jersey you have once you have sent it back to me, as well as removed the negative review for me.\n1699392376 Buyer: I agree to a refund upon return receipt of the jersey and removal of the negative review so long as you remove the one left for me as well. \n1699392437 Seller: Ok.

Do we have an agreement then?\n1699392479 Seller: I think that we do.\n1699392513 Buyer: Wonderful. Thank you kindly. I know we need to continue to correspond, so do you know when your Kobe jersey's will arrive?\n1699392568 Seller: I do have a shipment coming in next week. That one costs more but I could get you one if you wish.\n1699392599 Buyer: That is fine. I'm more than happy to pay more for the jersey that will make him happy. I'll send this jersey back tomorrow with tracking information for you.\n1699392615 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1699392624 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

I was aiming to get a refund back and a apology as I ordered this for my ill family member. \n1701286743 Seller: I'm sorry you were under the impression that the jerseys on my website were for specific players.

I apologize for any confusion.\n1701286870 Buyer: Well I feel very mislead in this regard. The website literally was all about Kobe Bryan. I demand that the negative and hurtful review of me is taken off my account along with a apology. I will fold on the refund. However I will not take down the review of you as that is my right and people should know to read the fine print when dealing with you.   \n1701287068 Seller: I am very sorry you feel this way. We are very passionate about Kobe Bryant and the entire Lakers organization. You have every right to keep the review of our business up online as I am a firm believer in the right to free speech however, I believe my company deserves the same respect in return to exercise our right to free speech as well. \n1701287179 Buyer: Already lets finalize a deal. No refund fine. You remove the negative review of me. I remove the negative review of you. And I get a apology for my ill relative, he is just a kid man. Show some compassion. Let me know if that works for you.   \n1701287257 Seller: I think that sounds reasonable. I would commit to that deal.\n1701287294 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701287316 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

         "1701384320 Buyer: I received the Jersey I ordered but it did not have the correct name on the back. I would like to return this jersey for the correct one or receive a full refund of my money\n1701384370 Seller: Hello, I am happy to explain. The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design. The product description does not include this was a Bryant jersey or specific number. \n1701384624 Buyer: To me, that is very unprofessional and also false advertising. I would think you would want to act more professional and provide a full return policy\n1701384747 Seller: I do apologize for the confusion. As my policy states I do not offer product refunds. Again the product listing and description does not state this was for a specific player or number. As this was not stated there was nothing false advertised. You can also see this Jersey does not contain a player name. \n1701384875 Buyer: Well, I disappointed in your approach in this matter. I feel I must place a review post that explains to others considering a purchase that there is some deception on what the ad proclaims and what you will actually receive. Also your reluctant to refund my purchase.\n1701384995 Seller: Again I do apologize for the confusion but as clearly stated on the product description as well as my return policy your order was fulfilled with the correct product purchased. \n1701385059 Buyer: I guess I will have to file a complaint against you with my credit card company explaining the situation.\n1701385138 Seller: You are more than welcome to reach out to to your credit card company and I am happy to provide them the product listing as well as a copy of your order invoice/confirmation that includes the product description purchased. \n1701385228 Buyer: And myself, being in possession of the original ad which showed the name of Bryant and his number in the ad, will pass that on to the credit card company as well\n1701385297 Seller: Again, I am happy to work with your credit card company providing the information from the order placed and description as well as my return policy. \n1701385385 Buyer: Ok then, I believe that my negative review of your false advertising will cost you a few sales. I hope you feel that is worth you not refunding my money.\n1701385585 Seller: I will gladly provide the same information in response to your review indicating I am following all of my policy listed on my site. I would also like you to be aware that I will be submitting a buyers review for your purchase as well for other companies to be informed of your request that is against my store policy. \n1701385630 Buyer: Ok, I guess we will see who this hurts more.\n1701385663 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701385701 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

We don't sell any Kobe jerseys\n1701384421 Buyer: I am 1000 percent sure that I ordered from you. I had left you a negative feedback and it seems that you left me one as well but maybe we can workout something?\n1701384451 Seller: Well I'm open to suggestions\n1701384502 Buyer: First, I would like to apologize, and I would appreciate if you'd do the same.

And I will send back the jersey as well. Maybe I made the error so what if you just do a partial refund and you get your jersey back?\n1701384703 Seller: So, we both apologize, both retract bad reviews, and you get a partial refund?\n1701384720 Buyer: Yes\n1701384760 Seller: Ok, let's do it.\n1701384774 Buyer: Thank you.

It's important for us both to be able to continue doing business here so I'd like to resolve this.  I'd like a refund for the jersey, I'll send this one back to you, and I'd like you to retract the negative review you left calling me names. \n1701385453 Seller: Hello buyer, thank you for being a frequent customer and I am sorry, but this honestly seems like a big misunderstanding. I clearly stated what the item was and it seems you misread the description and I think it is very harsh for you to write a review calling me a LIAR and CROOK before reaching out for a resolution. Would you consider deleting your negative review if I offered you a refund?\n1701385605 Buyer: I do agree, there's a big misunderstanding. I don't think you were malicious or lied intentionally, but the item description did say Kobe Bryant. This no-name player's jersey wouldn't have fetched $75, but Kobe's would have. I think it's appropriate to leave my review, however I'd be happy to edit it so other buyers know you were willing to work with me on a compromise. I'm sorry for all this, I know it's not easy to have disputes with customers. \n1701385775 Seller: I am sorry that I have to disagree, but the description was for a generic Lakers jersey and did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I agree with you that the price is a bit steep for a general Lakers jersey, so I can understand your assumption that it was for a specific player. I would greatly prefer if you deleted your negative review though, because it affects my business adversely, and you don't have anything to lose if you get a full refund and return the jersey to me.\n1701385939 Buyer: I'd like to maintain my stellar reputation on this platform. I understand you would like to as well, which is why I'm willing to edit my review. It's very important that I receive a refund, as the gift for my relative is to be specifically a Kobe jersey.  I'll pay return shipping but I'd like the jersey refunded, please. \n1701386066 Seller: Well, if you are willing to edit your review, then I will edit mine as well and say that you were willing to reach an agreement with me and we can consider this dispute settled. I am happy to offer you a full refund and am sorry for the misunderstanding and inconveniences this has caused. Unfortunately, since you are not willing to delete your review, then I cannot delete mine either, and we will both need to edit our reviews to reflect what we discussed today. Agreed?\n1701386138 Buyer: I appreciate you working with me on this. That solution makes me happy. I'll go edit my review now and will get this jersey shipped to you in exchange for the refund. \n1701386326 Seller: Thank you for working with me to resolve this issue. I don't typically offer refunds, so I hope you understand that this is an extension of my sincerity and effort to strive for satisfactory customer service by offering you this exception. We'll both edit our reviews then. Thanks again!\n1701386346 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701386375 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

I'm willing to send back the jersey and amend my review if you'll work with me. No chance?\n1701385775 Seller: No chance. You can stop trying to bribe and threaten me. It won't work.\n1701385829 Buyer: I Walk Away.\n",

I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon. What can I do for you?\n1699389451 Buyer:  I was just going to say have a great rest of your day! \n1699389479 Seller: Thank you, you too!\n1699389486 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1699389501 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design. The product description does not include this was a Bryant jersey or specific number. \n1701384624 Buyer: To me, that is very unprofessional and also false advertising. I would think you would want to act more professional and provide a full return policy\n1701384747 Seller: I do apologize for the confusion. As my policy states I do not offer product refunds. Again the product listing and description does not state this was for a specific player or number. As this was not stated there was nothing false advertised. You can also see this Jersey does not contain a player name. \n1701384875 Buyer: Well, I disappointed in your approach in this matter. I feel I must place a review post that explains to others considering a purchase that there is some deception on what the ad proclaims and what you will actually receive. Also your reluctant to refund my purchase.\n1701384995 Seller: Again I do apologize for the confusion but as clearly stated on the product description as well as my return policy your order was fulfilled with the correct product purchased. \n1701385059 Buyer: I guess I will have to file a complaint against you with my credit card company explaining the situation.\n1701385138 Seller: You are more than welcome to reach out to to your credit card company and I am happy to provide them the product listing as well as a copy of your order invoice/confirmation that includes the product description purchased. \n1701385228 Buyer: And myself, being in possession of the original ad which showed the name of Bryant and his number in the ad, will pass that on to the credit card company as well\n1701385297 Seller: Again, I am happy to work with your credit card company providing the information from the order placed and description as well as my return policy. \n1701385385 Buyer: Ok then, I believe that my negative review of your false advertising will cost you a few sales. I hope you feel that is worth you not refunding my money.\n1701385585 Seller: I will gladly provide the same information in response to your review indicating I am following all of my policy listed on my site. I would also like you to be aware that I will be submitting a buyers review for your purchase as well for other companies to be informed of your request that is against my store policy. \n1701385630 Buyer: Ok, I guess we will see who this hurts more.\n1701385663 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701385701 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

We don't sell any Kobe jerseys\n1701384421 Buyer: I am 1000 percent sure that I ordered from you.

It's important for us both to be able to continue doing business here so I'd like to resolve this.  I'd like a refund for the jersey, I'll send this one back to you, and I'd like you to retract the negative review you left calling me names. \n1701385453 Seller: Hello buyer, thank you for being a frequent customer and I am sorry, but this honestly seems like a big misunderstanding. I clearly stated what the item was and it seems you misread the description and I think it is very harsh for you to write a review calling me a LIAR and CROOK before reaching out for a resolution. Would you consider deleting your negative review if I offered you a refund?\n1701385605 Buyer: I do agree, there's a big misunderstanding. I don't think you were malicious or lied intentionally, but the item description did say Kobe Bryant. This no-name player's jersey wouldn't have fetched $75, but Kobe's would have. I think it's appropriate to leave my review, however I'd be happy to edit it so other buyers know you were willing to work with me on a compromise. I'm sorry for all this, I know it's not easy to have disputes with customers. \n1701385775 Seller: I am sorry that I have to disagree, but the description was for a generic Lakers jersey and did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I agree with you that the price is a bit steep for a general Lakers jersey, so I can understand your assumption that it was for a specific player. I would greatly prefer if you deleted your negative review though, because it affects my business adversely, and you don't have anything to lose if you get a full refund and return the jersey to me.\n1701385939 Buyer: I'd like to maintain my stellar reputation on this platform. I understand you would like to as well, which is why I'm willing to edit my review. It's very important that I receive a refund, as the gift for my relative is to be specifically a Kobe jersey.  I'll pay return shipping but I'd like the jersey refunded, please. \n1701386066 Seller: Well, if you are willing to edit your review, then I will edit mine as well and say that you were willing to reach an agreement with me and we can consider this dispute settled. I am happy to offer you a full refund and am sorry for the misunderstanding and inconveniences this has caused. Unfortunately, since you are not willing to delete your review, then I cannot delete mine either, and we will both need to edit our reviews to reflect what we discussed today. Agreed?\n1701386138 Buyer: I appreciate you working with me on this. That solution makes me happy. I'll go edit my review now and will get this jersey shipped to you in exchange for the refund. \n1701386326 Seller: Thank you for working with me to resolve this issue. I don't typically offer refunds, so I hope you understand that this is an extension of my sincerity and effort to strive for satisfactory customer service by offering you this exception. We'll both edit our reviews then. Thanks again!\n1701386346 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701386375 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

         "1699388451 Buyer: Hi there! I believe I received the wrong jersey from you! I was wondering if I could get a refund on my purchase? \n1699388553 Seller: Good afternoon! I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon. What can I do for you?\n1699389451 Buyer:  I was just going to say have a great rest of your day! \n1699389479 Seller: Thank you, you too!\n1699389486 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1699389501 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

The ad that I have does not say that it is a Kobe jersey. A store policy is that all sales are final. \n1699392234 Buyer: I understand that the ad doesn't say that now, but it did when I purchased the jersey. I would be more than happy to exchange it for the correct jersey and amend my review if that's done.\n1699392347 Seller: Well we are not selling the Kobe jersies for that price. The most I would be willing to do is that I will give you a refund for the jersey you have once you have sent it back to me, as well as removed the negative review for me.\n1699392376 Buyer: I agree to a refund upon return receipt of the jersey and removal of the negative review so long as you remove the one left for me as well. \n1699392437 Seller: Ok. I am willing to retract my review as well. \n1699392459 Buyer: Perfect, I am appreciative we were able to resolve this. Do we have an agreement then?\n1699392479 Seller: I think that we do.\n1699392513 Buyer: Wonderful. Thank you kindly. I know we need to continue to correspond, so do you know when your Kobe jersey's will arrive?\n1699392568 Seller: I do have a shipment coming in next week. That one costs more but I could get you one if you wish.\n1699392599 Buyer: That is fine. I'm more than happy to pay more for the jersey that will make him happy. I'll send this jersey back tomorrow with tracking information for you.\n1699392615 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1699392624 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

I apologize for any confusion.\n1701286870 Buyer: Well I feel very mislead in this regard. The website literally was all about Kobe Bryan. I demand that the negative and hurtful review of me is taken off my account along with a apology. I will fold on the refund. However I will not take down the review of you as that is my right and people should know to read the fine print when dealing with you.   \n1701287068 Seller: I am very sorry you feel this way. We are very passionate about Kobe Bryant and the entire Lakers organization. You have every right to keep the review of our business up online as I am a firm believer in the right to free speech however, I believe my company deserves the same respect in return to exercise our right to free speech as well. \n1701287179 Buyer: Already lets finalize a deal. No refund fine. You remove the negative review of me. I remove the negative review of you. And I get a apology for my ill relative, he is just a kid man. Show some compassion. Let me know if that works for you.   \n1701287257 Seller: I think that sounds reasonable. I would commit to that deal.\n1701287294 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701287316 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

         "1701384320 Buyer: I received the Jersey I ordered but it did not have the correct name on the back. I would like to return this jersey for the correct one or receive a full refund of my money\n1701384370 Seller: Hello, I am happy to explain. The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design. The product description does not include this was a Bryant jersey or specific number. \n1701384624 Buyer: To me, that is very unprofessional and also false advertising. I would think you would want to act more professional and provide a full return policy\n1701384747 Seller: I do apologize for the confusion. As my policy states I do not offer product refunds. Again the product listing and description does not state this was for a specific player or number. As this was not stated there was nothing false advertised. You can also see this Jersey does not contain a player name. \n1701384875 Buyer: Well, I disappointed in your approach in this matter. I feel I must place a review post that explains to others considering a purchase that there is some deception on what the ad proclaims and what you will actually receive. Also your reluctant to refund my purchase.\n1701384995 Seller: Again I do apologize for the confusion but as clearly stated on the product description as well as my return policy your order was fulfilled with the correct product purchased. \n1701385059 Buyer: I guess I will have to file a complaint against you with my credit card company explaining the situation.\n1701385138 Seller: You are more than welcome to reach out to to your credit card company and I am happy to provide them the product listing as well as a copy of your order invoice/confirmation that includes the product description purchased. \n1701385228 Buyer: And myself, being in possession of the original ad which showed the name of Bryant and his number in the ad, will pass that on to the credit card company as well\n1701385297 Seller: Again, I am happy to work with your credit card company providing the information from the order placed and description as well as my return policy. \n1701385385 Buyer: Ok then, I believe that my negative review of your false advertising will cost you a few sales. I hope you feel that is worth you not refunding my money.\n1701385585 Seller: I will gladly provide the same information in response to your review indicating I am following all of my policy listed on my site. I would also like you to be aware that I will be submitting a buyers review for your purchase as well for other companies to be informed of your request that is against my store policy. \n1701385630 Buyer: Ok, I guess we will see who this hurts more.\n1701385663 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701385701 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

We don't sell any Kobe jerseys\n1701384421 Buyer: I am 1000 percent sure that I ordered from you. I had left you a negative feedback and it seems that you left me one as well but maybe we can workout something?\n1701384451 Seller: Well I'm open to suggestions\n1701384502 Buyer: First, I would like to apologize, and I would appreciate if you'd do the same. I'm sure it was an honest mistake \n1701384551 Seller: Sure.  I'm happy to apologize for any errors made here\n1701384640 Buyer: Thanks. I would also appreciate if you'd remove the negative feedback. And I will send back the jersey as well. Maybe I made the error so what if you just do a partial refund and you get your jersey back?\n1701384703 Seller: So, we both apologize, both retract bad reviews, and you get a partial refund?\n1701384720 Buyer: Yes\n1701384760 Seller: Ok, let's do it.\n1701384774 Buyer: Thank you.

It's important for us both to be able to continue doing business here so I'd like to resolve this.  I'd like a refund for the jersey, I'll send this one back to you, and I'd like you to retract the negative review you left calling me names. \n1701385453 Seller: Hello buyer, thank you for being a frequent customer and I am sorry, but this honestly seems like a big misunderstanding. I clearly stated what the item was and it seems you misread the description and I think it is very harsh for you to write a review calling me a LIAR and CROOK before reaching out for a resolution. Would you consider deleting your negative review if I offered you a refund?\n1701385605 Buyer: I do agree, there's a big misunderstanding. I don't think you were malicious or lied intentionally, but the item description did say Kobe Bryant. This no-name player's jersey wouldn't have fetched $75, but Kobe's would have. I think it's appropriate to leave my review, however I'd be happy to edit it so other buyers know you were willing to work with me on a compromise. I'm sorry for all this, I know it's not easy to have disputes with customers. \n1701385775 Seller: I am sorry that I have to disagree, but the description was for a generic Lakers jersey and did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I agree with you that the price is a bit steep for a general Lakers jersey, so I can understand your assumption that it was for a specific player. I would greatly prefer if you deleted your negative review though, because it affects my business adversely, and you don't have anything to lose if you get a full refund and return the jersey to me.\n1701385939 Buyer: I'd like to maintain my stellar reputation on this platform. I understand you would like to as well, which is why I'm willing to edit my review. It's very important that I receive a refund, as the gift for my relative is to be specifically a Kobe jersey.  I'll pay return shipping but I'd like the jersey refunded, please. \n1701386066 Seller: Well, if you are willing to edit your review, then I will edit mine as well and say that you were willing to reach an agreement with me and we can consider this dispute settled. I am happy to offer you a full refund and am sorry for the misunderstanding and inconveniences this has caused. Unfortunately, since you are not willing to delete your review, then I cannot delete mine either, and we will both need to edit our reviews to reflect what we discussed today. Agreed?\n1701386138 Buyer: I appreciate you working with me on this. That solution makes me happy. I'll go edit my review now and will get this jersey shipped to you in exchange for the refund. \n1701386326 Seller: Thank you for working with me to resolve this issue. I don't typically offer refunds, so I hope you understand that this is an extension of my sincerity and effort to strive for satisfactory customer service by offering you this exception. We'll both edit our reviews then. Thanks again!\n1701386346 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701386375 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

I'll take the partial refund , But I am going to complain about  you.

         "1701385266 Buyer: Hi, I did not receive the correct jersey. But I understand mistakes may happen. If you give me a full refund, I'll edit my review to say we reached an understanding.\n1701385312 Seller: Hello! You receive the exact jersey that I clearly described on my website.\n1701385421 Buyer: Unfortunately, it is not the jersey I wanted. I'll be happy to send the jersey back for a refund, if you supply a label. If not, I'll be forced to file a credit card reversal with my credit card company.\n1701385468 Seller: Well, you should have paid more attention when you were purchasing the jersey. I have a no return policy.\n1701385581 Buyer: I'd love to work with you here so we can resolve this amicably, so if you'll send me a return label and give me a refund I'll edit my review of you to explain that we reached an agreement. But if we can't work together I will file a credit card chargeback, and as I'm sure you know that will be expensive for you. Let's try to work together here.\n1701385617 Seller: No. I have a no return policy.\n1701385735 Buyer: I'm sure you're aware that if I file a chargeback, the credit card company will give me my money back. I'm willing to send back the jersey and amend my review if you'll work with me. No chance?\n1701385775 Seller: No chance. You can stop trying to bribe and threaten me. It won't work.\n1701385829 Buyer: I Walk Away.\n",

         "1699388451 Buyer: Hi there! I believe I received the wrong jersey from you! I was wondering if I could get a refund on my purchase? \n1699388553 Seller: Good afternoon! I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon. What can I do for you?\n1699389451 Buyer:  I was just going to say have a great rest of your day! \n1699389479 Seller: Thank you, you too!\n1699389486 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1699389501 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

It is a gift for my nephew who is ill in the hospital and I'm not willing to disappoint him.\n1699392149 Seller: I am very sorry to hear that. I understand that this may be frustrating. The ad that I have does not say that it is a Kobe jersey. A store policy is that all sales are final. \n1699392234 Buyer: I understand that the ad doesn't say that now, but it did when I purchased the jersey. I would be more than happy to exchange it for the correct jersey and amend my review if that's done.\n1699392347 Seller: Well we are not selling the Kobe jersies for that price. The most I would be willing to do is that I will give you a refund for the jersey you have once you have sent it back to me, as well as removed the negative review for me.\n1699392376 Buyer: I agree to a refund upon return receipt of the jersey and removal of the negative review so long as you remove the one left for me as well. \n1699392437 Seller: Ok. I am willing to retract my review as well. \n1699392459 Buyer: Perfect, I am appreciative we were able to resolve this. Do we have an agreement then?\n1699392479 Seller: I think that we do.\n1699392513 Buyer: Wonderful. Thank you kindly. I know we need to continue to correspond, so do you know when your Kobe jersey's will arrive?\n1699392568 Seller: I do have a shipment coming in next week. That one costs more but I could get you one if you wish.\n1699392599 Buyer: That is fine. I'm more than happy to pay more for the jersey that will make him happy. I'll send this jersey back tomorrow with tracking information for you.\n1699392615 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1699392624 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

What seems to be the issue?\n1701286603 Buyer: I ordered a Kobe Byrant jersey but received a random jersey. When I went to the site again, all mention of Kobe Bryant was removed. I was aiming to get a refund back and a apology as I ordered this for my ill family member. \n1701286743 Seller: I'm sorry you were under the impression that the jerseys on my website were for specific players. The item never stated that it was for a specific player and no wording has been removed from the website. We also have an \"All Sales Are Final\" company policy. I apologize for any confusion.\n1701286870 Buyer: Well I feel very mislead in this regard. The website literally was all about Kobe Bryan. I demand that the negative and hurtful review of me is taken off my account along with a apology. I will fold on the refund. However I will not take down the review of you as that is my right and people should know to read the fine print when dealing with you.   \n1701287068 Seller: I am very sorry you feel this way. We are very passionate about Kobe Bryant and the entire Lakers organization. You have every right to keep the review of our business up online as I am a firm believer in the right to free speech however, I believe my company deserves the same respect in return to exercise our right to free speech as well. \n1701287179 Buyer: Already lets finalize a deal. No refund fine. You remove the negative review of me. I remove the negative review of you. And I get a apology for my ill relative, he is just a kid man. Show some compassion. Let me know if that works for you.   \n1701287257 Seller: I think that sounds reasonable. I would commit to that deal.\n1701287294 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701287316 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

You might get the full amount. \n1701288089 Buyer: What do you mean might get the full amount?

Full refunding isn't allowed. May I suggest you accept the partial refund.\n1701288275 Buyer: Why should I accept a partial refund if I did not get what I ordered?  I can report your company as fraudulent and my credit card company will give me a full refund.  \n1701288406 Seller: Why would you report the company for fraudulent activity. Did you at least check properly if that's what you ordered.\n1701288450 Buyer: I have a screen shot of what I ordered.  It was a Kobe bryant jersey, not some unknow player\n1701288624 Seller: Okay.

I would like to return this jersey for the correct one or receive a full refund of my money\n1701384370 Seller: Hello, I am happy to explain. The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design. The product description does not include this was a Bryant jersey or specific number. \n1701384624 Buyer: To me, that is very unprofessional and also false advertising. I would think you would want to act more professional and provide a full return policy\n1701384747 Seller: I do apologize for the confusion. As my policy states I do not offer product refunds. Again the product listing and description does not state this was for a specific player or number. As this was not stated there was nothing false advertised. You can also see this Jersey does not contain a player name. \n1701384875 Buyer: Well, I disappointed in your approach in this matter. I feel I must place a review post that explains to others considering a purchase that there is some deception on what the ad proclaims and what you will actually receive. Also your reluctant to refund my purchase.\n1701384995 Seller: Again I do apologize for the confusion but as clearly stated on the product description as well as my return policy your order was fulfilled with the correct product purchased. \n1701385059 Buyer: I guess I will have to file a complaint against you with my credit card company explaining the situation.\n1701385138 Seller: You are more than welcome to reach out to to your credit card company and I am happy to provide them the product listing as well as a copy of your order invoice/confirmation that includes the product description purchased. \n1701385228 Buyer: And myself, being in possession of the original ad which showed the name of Bryant and his number in the ad, will pass that on to the credit card company as well\n1701385297 Seller: Again, I am happy to work with your credit card company providing the information from the order placed and description as well as my return policy. \n1701385385 Buyer: Ok then, I believe that my negative review of your false advertising will cost you a few sales. I hope you feel that is worth you not refunding my money.\n1701385585 Seller: I will gladly provide the same information in response to your review indicating I am following all of my policy listed on my site. I would also like you to be aware that I will be submitting a buyers review for your purchase as well for other companies to be informed of your request that is against my store policy. \n1701385630 Buyer: Ok, I guess we will see who this hurts more.\n1701385663 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701385701 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

We don't sell any Kobe jerseys\n1701384421 Buyer: I am 1000 percent sure that I ordered from you.

And I will send back the jersey as well. Maybe I made the error so what if you just do a partial refund and you get your jersey back?\n1701384703 Seller: So, we both apologize, both retract bad reviews, and you get a partial refund?\n1701384720 Buyer: Yes\n1701384760 Seller: Ok, let's do it.\n1701384774 Buyer: Thank you.

It's important for us both to be able to continue doing business here so I'd like to resolve this.  I'd like a refund for the jersey, I'll send this one back to you, and I'd like you to retract the negative review you left calling me names. \n1701385453 Seller: Hello buyer, thank you for being a frequent customer and I am sorry, but this honestly seems like a big misunderstanding. I clearly stated what the item was and it seems you misread the description and I think it is very harsh for you to write a review calling me a LIAR and CROOK before reaching out for a resolution. Would you consider deleting your negative review if I offered you a refund?\n1701385605 Buyer: I do agree, there's a big misunderstanding. I don't think you were malicious or lied intentionally, but the item description did say Kobe Bryant. This no-name player's jersey wouldn't have fetched $75, but Kobe's would have. I think it's appropriate to leave my review, however I'd be happy to edit it so other buyers know you were willing to work with me on a compromise. I'm sorry for all this, I know it's not easy to have disputes with customers. \n1701385775 Seller: I am sorry that I have to disagree, but the description was for a generic Lakers jersey and did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I agree with you that the price is a bit steep for a general Lakers jersey, so I can understand your assumption that it was for a specific player. I would greatly prefer if you deleted your negative review though, because it affects my business adversely, and you don't have anything to lose if you get a full refund and return the jersey to me.\n1701385939 Buyer: I'd like to maintain my stellar reputation on this platform. I understand you would like to as well, which is why I'm willing to edit my review. It's very important that I receive a refund, as the gift for my relative is to be specifically a Kobe jersey.  I'll pay return shipping but I'd like the jersey refunded, please. \n1701386066 Seller: Well, if you are willing to edit your review, then I will edit mine as well and say that you were willing to reach an agreement with me and we can consider this dispute settled. I am happy to offer you a full refund and am sorry for the misunderstanding and inconveniences this has caused. Unfortunately, since you are not willing to delete your review, then I cannot delete mine either, and we will both need to edit our reviews to reflect what we discussed today. Agreed?\n1701386138 Buyer: I appreciate you working with me on this. That solution makes me happy. I'll go edit my review now and will get this jersey shipped to you in exchange for the refund. \n1701386326 Seller: Thank you for working with me to resolve this issue. I don't typically offer refunds, so I hope you understand that this is an extension of my sincerity and effort to strive for satisfactory customer service by offering you this exception. We'll both edit our reviews then. Thanks again!\n1701386346 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701386375 Seller: Accept Deal\n",
