I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon. What can I do for you?\n1699389451 Buyer:  I was just going to say have a great rest of your day! \n1699389479 Seller: Thank you, you too!\n1699389486 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1699389501 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

You simply purchased the jersey and I sent it to you. I am willing to work with you if you're that unhappy, but you have to understand where I am coming from too.\n1701301504 Buyer: The advertising stated that I know I wasn't talking to you directly are you willing to refund me for the purchase?\n1701301546 Seller: No, I can't refund you. You purchased the jersey under the listing that never stated any particular name. Are you able to review the listing again?\n1701301609 Buyer: You've conveniently altered the listing so that it indicates no specific player, the original listing, did in fact state it was for a Kobe Bryant jersey.\n1701301670 Seller: That's not possible for me to alter the listing. The listing is the same as the one you purchased. I can see how you could have misread or thought it was a specific player. So, If you apologize I will apologize as well. \n1701301736 Buyer: I'll accept the retraction of your bad review, I don't need the unwarranted hit to my rep.\n1701301781 Seller: Okay, I will also apologize for the misunderstanding with the listing and next time I will provide a clear detail in the listings for future customers.\n1701301804 Buyer: Thank you that's fine\n1701301835 Seller: Will you please also retract the bad review that you wrote me?\n1701301936 Buyer: I will, this one time, but if you try that kind of deal again I'm going to screen print the original screen it and let the site know what you're up to.\n1701302001 Seller: It was never my intention to deceive anyone. I apologize for the misunderstanding and wish you a good rest of your week.\n1701302009 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701302038 Seller: Reject Deal\n1701302076 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701302084 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design. The product description does not include this was a Bryant jersey or specific number. \n1701384624 Buyer: To me, that is very unprofessional and also false advertising. I would think you would want to act more professional and provide a full return policy\n1701384747 Seller: I do apologize for the confusion. As my policy states I do not offer product refunds. Again the product listing and description does not state this was for a specific player or number. As this was not stated there was nothing false advertised. You can also see this Jersey does not contain a player name. \n1701384875 Buyer: Well, I disappointed in your approach in this matter. I feel I must place a review post that explains to others considering a purchase that there is some deception on what the ad proclaims and what you will actually receive. Also your reluctant to refund my purchase.\n1701384995 Seller: Again I do apologize for the confusion but as clearly stated on the product description as well as my return policy your order was fulfilled with the correct product purchased. \n1701385059 Buyer: I guess I will have to file a complaint against you with my credit card company explaining the situation.\n1701385138 Seller: You are more than welcome to reach out to to your credit card company and I am happy to provide them the product listing as well as a copy of your order invoice/confirmation that includes the product description purchased. \n1701385228 Buyer: And myself, being in possession of the original ad which showed the name of Bryant and his number in the ad, will pass that on to the credit card company as well\n1701385297 Seller: Again, I am happy to work with your credit card company providing the information from the order placed and description as well as my return policy. \n1701385385 Buyer: Ok then, I believe that my negative review of your false advertising will cost you a few sales. I hope you feel that is worth you not refunding my money.\n1701385585 Seller: I will gladly provide the same information in response to your review indicating I am following all of my policy listed on my site. I would also like you to be aware that I will be submitting a buyers review for your purchase as well for other companies to be informed of your request that is against my store policy. \n1701385630 Buyer: Ok, I guess we will see who this hurts more.\n1701385663 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701385701 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

It's important for us both to be able to continue doing business here so I'd like to resolve this.  I'd like a refund for the jersey, I'll send this one back to you, and I'd like you to retract the negative review you left calling me names. \n1701385453 Seller: Hello buyer, thank you for being a frequent customer and I am sorry, but this honestly seems like a big misunderstanding. I clearly stated what the item was and it seems you misread the description and I think it is very harsh for you to write a review calling me a LIAR and CROOK before reaching out for a resolution. Would you consider deleting your negative review if I offered you a refund?\n1701385605 Buyer: I do agree, there's a big misunderstanding. I don't think you were malicious or lied intentionally, but the item description did say Kobe Bryant. This no-name player's jersey wouldn't have fetched $75, but Kobe's would have. I think it's appropriate to leave my review, however I'd be happy to edit it so other buyers know you were willing to work with me on a compromise. I'm sorry for all this, I know it's not easy to have disputes with customers. \n1701385775 Seller: I am sorry that I have to disagree, but the description was for a generic Lakers jersey and did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I agree with you that the price is a bit steep for a general Lakers jersey, so I can understand your assumption that it was for a specific player. I would greatly prefer if you deleted your negative review though, because it affects my business adversely, and you don't have anything to lose if you get a full refund and return the jersey to me.\n1701385939 Buyer: I'd like to maintain my stellar reputation on this platform. I understand you would like to as well, which is why I'm willing to edit my review. It's very important that I receive a refund, as the gift for my relative is to be specifically a Kobe jersey.  I'll pay return shipping but I'd like the jersey refunded, please. \n1701386066 Seller: Well, if you are willing to edit your review, then I will edit mine as well and say that you were willing to reach an agreement with me and we can consider this dispute settled. I am happy to offer you a full refund and am sorry for the misunderstanding and inconveniences this has caused. Unfortunately, since you are not willing to delete your review, then I cannot delete mine either, and we will both need to edit our reviews to reflect what we discussed today. Agreed?\n1701386138 Buyer: I appreciate you working with me on this. That solution makes me happy. I'll go edit my review now and will get this jersey shipped to you in exchange for the refund. \n1701386326 Seller: Thank you for working with me to resolve this issue. I don't typically offer refunds, so I hope you understand that this is an extension of my sincerity and effort to strive for satisfactory customer service by offering you this exception. We'll both edit our reviews then. Thanks again!\n1701386346 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701386375 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

I'm happy to remove my bad review of your store if you put a refund through.  I'll return the jersey and hope you would also remove your negative review of me.  \n1701467347 Seller: No, the site did not state this and it has not been edited. If English is not your first language then perhaps you should not be ordering products online. I will not remove my negative review of you and there is no refund for your mistake.\n1701467496 Buyer: So, you're willing to have a bad review stay on your website?  When you could fix it by doing the right thing?  What happened to \"the customer is always right?\"  I would never want an old Robert Horry jersey which is what I got...\n1701467636 Seller: Only customers believe that they are correct even when the mistake is theirs. Again I will not issue a refund for a transaction when the mistake is yours and at this point I could not resell the jersey as new in package and would have to reduce the price. Own your mistake and purchase a Kobe jersey for your friend...elsewhere. Thank you for your business, good day.\n1701467810 Buyer: I'll be sure to tell this to my terminally-ill family member who only wanted a Kobe jersey.  The picture of a jersey with \"Bryant\" on the back somehow led me to believe that's what I was getting.  I'm sending you some options for us to resolve this shortly.  \n1701467932 Seller: None are needed as I will not be offering a refund and you can keep your review as it is your opinion of the transaction. Again, thank you for your business and this concludes this conversation.\n1701467942 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701467955 Seller: I Walk Away.\n",

I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon. What can I do for you?\n1699389451 Buyer:  I was just going to say have a great rest of your day! \n1699389479 Seller: Thank you, you too!\n1699389486 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1699389501 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

I would like to return this jersey for the correct one or receive a full refund of my money\n1701384370 Seller: Hello, I am happy to explain. The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design. The product description does not include this was a Bryant jersey or specific number. \n1701384624 Buyer: To me, that is very unprofessional and also false advertising. I would think you would want to act more professional and provide a full return policy\n1701384747 Seller: I do apologize for the confusion. As my policy states I do not offer product refunds. Again the product listing and description does not state this was for a specific player or number. As this was not stated there was nothing false advertised. You can also see this Jersey does not contain a player name. \n1701384875 Buyer: Well, I disappointed in your approach in this matter. I feel I must place a review post that explains to others considering a purchase that there is some deception on what the ad proclaims and what you will actually receive. Also your reluctant to refund my purchase.\n1701384995 Seller: Again I do apologize for the confusion but as clearly stated on the product description as well as my return policy your order was fulfilled with the correct product purchased. \n1701385059 Buyer: I guess I will have to file a complaint against you with my credit card company explaining the situation.\n1701385138 Seller: You are more than welcome to reach out to to your credit card company and I am happy to provide them the product listing as well as a copy of your order invoice/confirmation that includes the product description purchased. \n1701385228 Buyer: And myself, being in possession of the original ad which showed the name of Bryant and his number in the ad, will pass that on to the credit card company as well\n1701385297 Seller: Again, I am happy to work with your credit card company providing the information from the order placed and description as well as my return policy. \n1701385385 Buyer: Ok then, I believe that my negative review of your false advertising will cost you a few sales. I hope you feel that is worth you not refunding my money.\n1701385585 Seller: I will gladly provide the same information in response to your review indicating I am following all of my policy listed on my site. I would also like you to be aware that I will be submitting a buyers review for your purchase as well for other companies to be informed of your request that is against my store policy. \n1701385630 Buyer: Ok, I guess we will see who this hurts more.\n1701385663 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701385701 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

It's important for us both to be able to continue doing business here so I'd like to resolve this.  I'd like a refund for the jersey, I'll send this one back to you, and I'd like you to retract the negative review you left calling me names. \n1701385453 Seller: Hello buyer, thank you for being a frequent customer and I am sorry, but this honestly seems like a big misunderstanding. I clearly stated what the item was and it seems you misread the description and I think it is very harsh for you to write a review calling me a LIAR and CROOK before reaching out for a resolution. Would you consider deleting your negative review if I offered you a refund?\n1701385605 Buyer: I do agree, there's a big misunderstanding. I don't think you were malicious or lied intentionally, but the item description did say Kobe Bryant. This no-name player's jersey wouldn't have fetched $75, but Kobe's would have. I think it's appropriate to leave my review, however I'd be happy to edit it so other buyers know you were willing to work with me on a compromise. I'm sorry for all this, I know it's not easy to have disputes with customers. \n1701385775 Seller: I am sorry that I have to disagree, but the description was for a generic Lakers jersey and did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I agree with you that the price is a bit steep for a general Lakers jersey, so I can understand your assumption that it was for a specific player. I would greatly prefer if you deleted your negative review though, because it affects my business adversely, and you don't have anything to lose if you get a full refund and return the jersey to me.\n1701385939 Buyer: I'd like to maintain my stellar reputation on this platform. I understand you would like to as well, which is why I'm willing to edit my review. It's very important that I receive a refund, as the gift for my relative is to be specifically a Kobe jersey.  I'll pay return shipping but I'd like the jersey refunded, please. \n1701386066 Seller: Well, if you are willing to edit your review, then I will edit mine as well and say that you were willing to reach an agreement with me and we can consider this dispute settled. I am happy to offer you a full refund and am sorry for the misunderstanding and inconveniences this has caused. Unfortunately, since you are not willing to delete your review, then I cannot delete mine either, and we will both need to edit our reviews to reflect what we discussed today. Agreed?\n1701386138 Buyer: I appreciate you working with me on this. That solution makes me happy. I'll go edit my review now and will get this jersey shipped to you in exchange for the refund. \n1701386326 Seller: Thank you for working with me to resolve this issue. I don't typically offer refunds, so I hope you understand that this is an extension of my sincerity and effort to strive for satisfactory customer service by offering you this exception. We'll both edit our reviews then. Thanks again!\n1701386346 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701386375 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

If I get my refund, and an apology for the misgivings, then I will retract my bad review. Does that sound fair enough?\n1701468078 Seller: The thing is there were no misgivings, so you can play ball or walk away. axe the review and make an apology and I'll offer you a partial refund\n1701468255 Buyer: Well that is nots going to suffice, as the money is not as important as me letting people know that you are running a scam. I know that you changed the ad after the fact and if it takes me losing money on my nephews gift for other people to not be scammed then so be it.\n1701468470 Seller: That was a ploy, I was never giving you a refund.

I will not remove my negative review of you and there is no refund for your mistake.\n1701467496 Buyer: So, you're willing to have a bad review stay on your website?

Own your mistake and purchase a Kobe jersey for your friend...elsewhere. Thank you for your business, good day.\n1701467810 Buyer: I'll be sure to tell this to my terminally-ill family member who only wanted a Kobe jersey.  The picture of a jersey with \"Bryant\" on the back somehow led me to believe that's what I was getting.  I'm sending you some options for us to resolve this shortly.  \n1701467932 Seller: None are needed as I will not be offering a refund and you can keep your review as it is your opinion of the transaction.

The product description indicated Kobe Bryant's jersey. You need to rectify this by giving a full refund.\n1701468482 Seller: It does not say that in the product description. It states that it is not for a specific player. Now who is being shoddy?\n1701468499 Buyer: Quit this nonsesnse. Pay back the full $75 or face a dispute claim with factual proof of your false advertising.\n1701468538 Seller: You'll lose that claim because the site states that it's not for a specific player. There is no reality where you get a refund because you made a mistake.\n1701468560 Buyer: I have evidence from when I purchased the jersey that it said Kobe Bryant on your site. Full refund or I have no choice but to escalate this.\n1701468631 Seller: Who are you going to escalate it to? The owner? That's me. The site clearly states that the jersey was not for a specific player.  All sales are final. You can't manipulate me into getting free things.\n1701468648 Buyer: You're a hustler, yet not clever. Full refund, or get ready for a dispute. I won't let you swindle others.\n1701468692 Seller: The only swindler here is you. All sales are final. I'll have no issue letting other places of business know of your deceptive practices and avoid selling to you.\n1701468710 Buyer: I demand you to remove your baseless review of me and issue a full refund ASAP. Enough of your lies and deception.\n1701468743 Seller: I demand you remove YOUR baseless and slanderous review of my store ASAP. All sales are final.\n1701468762 Buyer: Full refund, then I remove my review, and you withdraw your falsely negative review of me. Will you play fair this time?\n1701468803 Seller: The only person who needs to play fair is you. The jersey was not for a specific player as stated on the website. All sales are final. \n1701468822 Buyer: Your deceit won't work. Give me the full refund and remove your fraudulent review, or prepare for a dispute. Let's see who's right.\n1701468890 Seller: There is no reality where you get a refund for a mistake you made. I've made this clear. Do what you think you have to, but there is no refund. All sales are final and the site states the jersey is not for a specific player.\n1701468909 Buyer: Enough tricks. Last chance. Full refund or I open a dispute and make sure everyone knows about your trickery. What's it gonna be?\n1701468946 Seller: Other businesses already know you're trying to scam your way into getting free things. I have no problem with you and your empty threats.\n1701468960 Buyer: Expect a dispute for my full $75. Your dishonest practices won't go unnoticed. You'll see.\n1701468988 Seller: I don't need to see anything. All sales are final. I'm not sure what you don't understand about that.\n1701469004 Buyer: You don't get it. A full refund or you'll face serious consequences for your underhanded conduct. Your call!\n1701469041 Seller: No, you don't get it. The consequences of your actions will bear fruit when other businesses reject you making purchases from them.\n1701469059 Buyer: I've had it. Full refund now plus take down your false review. This is my final demand. Don't push me further.\n1701469102 Seller: Do it. Make your empty threats. There is not a chance you're getting a refund for not being able to read a product description. You have no evidence and you have no refund. \n1701469120 Buyer: That's it. Full refund, remove the false review or prepare for an ugly showdown. This is not a threat, it's a promise.\n1701469179 Seller: I could get the authorities involved for your slanderous review of my business. I'm sure they'll have plenty to say to you when they see you can't a product description.\n1701469199 Buyer: Prepare for a dispute. No more warnings. I want my full $75 refund and your false review removed. Your fraudulent acts won't go unpunished!\n1701469232 Seller: You've been warning me for over 5 minutes. It's not my problem if you don't know how to read a product description.\n1701469252 Buyer: I absolutely stand by my right. Final call - Full $75 refund and take down your made-up review of me, or face the consequences.\n1701469294 Seller: You don't have a right. The site states that the jersey is not for a specific player. If you can't comprehend that, then that's on you for making the mistake. \n1701469312 Buyer: I have everything documented. Present a full refund and remove your bogus review now, or prepare to face the dispute. Enough said.\n1701469327 Seller: If enough is said then do it. \n1701469343 Buyer: Getting my full refund and your nonsense review taken down will be my priority now. You asked for it.\n1701469382 Seller: Go ahead and try. You clearly don't have a leg to stand on otherwise you would have disputed already with all the \"evidence\" you claim to have.\n1701469399 Buyer: This fiasco ends now. Refund the full amount and remove your false review or I get this escalated. Your choice!\n1701469408 Seller: Escalate away. You won't win.\n1701469422 Buyer: Full refund. Remove the false review. This is your last chance. You'll regret not taking it.\n1701469450 Seller: That's at least 3 times now where you've said it's my last chance. How many more of those do I get before you owe me a refund?\n1701469466 Buyer: That's it. Sending full dispute for my $75 and your false review. Expect hell because it's coming.\n1701469480 Seller: Congratulations. You still won't get a refund because you're wrong.\n1701469498 Buyer: You'll see. Full refund and withdraw your review, or brace yourself. Now it's on. Goodbye.\n1701469509 Seller: Goodbye then.\n1701469525 Buyer: You're gonna wish you cooperated. Watch this space. You're just digging a bigger hole for yourself.\n1701469530 Seller: I Walk Away.\n",
