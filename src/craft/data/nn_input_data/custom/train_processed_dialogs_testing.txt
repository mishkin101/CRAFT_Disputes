I sure could use most of the firewood for us to keep warm at night, I have poor blood circulation and kind of need it so I can function. The water is not a big deal to me. We can melt the snow for extra drinking water and boil it if need be. I would like one extra food too."}, {"text": "I can relate to the need to keep warm at night!  Arthritis aches bad when I'm chilly.  It will be cold in the mountains for sure.  I can see you need extra.  How about you take 2?  I'm good on food so you can have what you need of that. Water would me nice.  If you can make do, I'd like at least 2 waters."}, {"text": "That would work perfectly for us. I will take the 2 wood, 1 water and 3 food?
